Why Objects are copied & compared by reference ?

Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the “object value”, 
but a “reference” (address in memory)for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function
argument copies that reference, not the object.

All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.
